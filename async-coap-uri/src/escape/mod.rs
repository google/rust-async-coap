//! # URI percent encoding/decoding ("URI Escaping")
//!
//! This module was written before the author was aware of the [`percent-encode`] crate.
//! Nonetheless, it has some convenient features that are not present in that crate,
//! so it remains in the X-URI crate for now.
//!
//! [`percent-encode`]: https://docs.rs/percent-encoding/2.0.0/percent_encoding/index.html
//!
//! It focuses solely on percent encoding/decoding of UTF8-encoded strings, treating all
//! percent-encoded strings that would otherwise decode to invalid UTF8 as themselves invalid.
//!
//! The primary interface to encoding and decoding is a provided trait that extends `str`:
//! [`StrExt`].
//!
//! Percent encoding is performed by [`escape_uri()`], which returns an iterator that
//! escapes the string. Likewise, percent decoding is performed by [`unescape_uri()`].
//!
//! As a special case, the trait also provides [`unescape_uri_in_place()`], which performs
//! in-place percent-decoding for a mutable string slice.
//!
//! # Usage Patterns
//!
//! The iterators returned by [`escape_uri()`] and [`unescape_uri()`] both implement
//! [`core::fmt::Display`], and thus also implement [`std::string::ToString`]:
//!
//! ```
//! use async_coap_uri::prelude::*;
//! let escaped_string = "This needs escaping".escape_uri().to_string();
//!
//! assert_eq!(&escaped_string, "This%20needs%20escaping");
//! ```
//!
//! Both methods also implent `From<Cow<str>>`:
//!
//! ```
//! # use async_coap_uri::prelude::*;
//! use std::borrow::Cow;
//! use std::convert::From;
//! let escaped_cow_str = Cow::from("This needs escaping?+3".escape_uri());
//!
//! assert_eq!(&escaped_cow_str, "This%20needs%20escaping%3F+3");
//! ```
//!
//! # Changing Behavior
//!
//! There is no one-size-fits-all escaping strategy for URIs: Some parts need to be excaped
//! differently than others. For example, *path segments* must have the `?` character escaped to
//! `%3F`, but this character is perfectly acceptable in the *query component*. Also, query
//! components have historically escaped the space character (` `) to the plus (`+`)
//! character, so pluses need to be escaped to `%2B`.
//!
//! By default, [`StrExt::escape_uri`] produces an iterator suitable for encoding *path segments*,
//! but other cases are handled by calling a modifier method on the [`EscapeUri`] iterator:
//!
//! ```
//! # use async_coap_uri::prelude::*;
//! let escaped_string = "This needs escaping?+3".escape_uri().for_query().to_string();
//!
//! assert_eq!(&escaped_string, "This+needs+escaping?%2B3");
//! ```
//!
//! The [`EscapeUri`] iterator also provides the modifier methods `for_fragment()` and `full()`
//! for encoding URI fragments and performing full percent encoding, respectively.
//!
//! ## Skipping Slashes
//!
//! The [`UnescapeUri`] iterator provides a modifier method for assisting in decoding the
//! entire URI *path component* (as opposed to individual *path segments*) where encoded
//! slashes (`%2F`) are not decoded, preserving the hierarchy:
//!
//! ```
//! # use async_coap_uri::prelude::*;
//! let escaped_string = "/this/p%20a%20t%20h/has%2Fextra/segments";
//!
//! let unescaped = escaped_string.unescape_uri().to_string();
//! assert_eq!(&unescaped, "/this/p a t h/has/extra/segments");
//!
//! let unescaped = escaped_string.unescape_uri().skip_slashes().to_string();
//! assert_eq!(&unescaped, "/this/p a t h/has%2Fextra/segments");
//! ```
//!
//! # Handling Encoding Errors
//!
//! While [`escape_uri()`] cannot fail, an escaped string can contain errors.
//! In situations where escaped characters cannot be properly decoded, the
//! [`unescape_uri()`] iterator will by default insert replacement characters
//! where errors are detected:
//!
//!  * Illegal escaped UTF8 errors are replaced with [`U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER`][U+FFFD] (`�`).
//!  * Escaped ASCII control codes are decoded as [Unicode Control Pictures] like `␀` and `␊`.
//!  * Unescaped ASCII control codes are dropped entirely.
//!
//! In cases where this is not appropriate, the iterator for [`unescape_uri()`] ([`UnescapeUri`])
//! provides the following methods:
//!
//! * [`first_error()`]\: Returns the location of the first detected encoding error, or `None` if
//!   there are no encoding errors.
//! * [`try_to_string()`]\: Returns an unescaped [`String`] only if no encoding errors were present.
//! * [`try_to_cow()`]\: Returns an unescaped [`Cow<str>`] only if no encoding errors were present.
//!
