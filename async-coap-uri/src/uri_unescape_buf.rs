/// # **Experimental**: In-place unescaping iteration helper
///
/// This object does in-place unescaping, so it takes ownership of a mutable
/// [`RelRefBuf`] in order to prevent access to it while it is being mutated in-place for
/// unescaping. This approach allows you to avoid an extra memory allocation per path segment.
///
/// This object is created via [`RelRefBuf::into_unescape_buf`].
///
/// The first attempt at writing this class tried to have the iterator itself own the
/// buffer, but that doesn't actually work. Further explanation regarding why can be
/// found on Jordan MacDonald's excellent blog post on the topic: [Reference Iterators in Rust][ref-iter].
///
/// [ref-iter]: https://medium.com/@jordan_98525/reference-iterators-in-rust-5603a51b5192
///
/// ## Example
///
/// ```
/// use async_coap_uri::prelude::*;
/// let rel_ref_buf = rel_ref!(unsafe "g:a/%2F/bl%c3%a5b%c3%a6r?q=g:a&q=%26&q=syltet%c3%b8y").to_owned();
/// let mut unescape_buf = rel_ref_buf.into_unescape_buf();
///
/// let mut query_item_iter = unescape_buf.query_items();
///
/// assert_eq!(query_item_iter.next(), Some("q=g:a"));
/// assert_eq!(query_item_iter.next(), Some("q=&"));
/// assert_eq!(query_item_iter.next(), Some("q=syltetøy"));
/// assert_eq!(query_item_iter.next(), None);
///
/// core::mem::drop(query_item_iter);
///
/// let mut path_seg_iter = unescape_buf.path_segments();
///
/// assert_eq!(path_seg_iter.next(), Some("g:a"));
/// assert_eq!(path_seg_iter.next(), Some("/"));
/// assert_eq!(path_seg_iter.next(), Some("blåbær"));
/// assert_eq!(path_seg_iter.next(), None);
